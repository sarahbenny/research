##Introduction
The goal of this project is to use machine learning to find a relationship 
between the structural and ______ properties of various water-in-salt electrolytes 
and their plating efficiencies and stability windows in aqueous batteries.

##Research Plan
* Run lots of MD simulations on electrolytes of various compositions and
   concentrations.
* Extract data on the atomic forces and nearest neighbor positions.
* Make sure data is translationally and rotationally invariant.
* Test NNPs to see if this approach is feasible.

##Progress
* Sarah Allec: Continuing to run MD simulations (primarily with SIESTA as DFTB+
  doesn't have an option to print forces at each timestep)
